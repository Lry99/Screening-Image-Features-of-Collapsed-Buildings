# Screening-Image-Features-of-Collapsed-Buildings

This folder contains two subfolders, named "code" and "data", respectively.


1. The subfolder "code" contains 25 scripts, each of which calculates the J-M distance and TD for one feature and outputs the results to the "results.txt" file in this folder.


2. The subfolder "data" contains the "Building Sample Set", which is the input data for the code mentioned above. It contains two subfolders named "single_cons_mat" and "single_cons_jpg", respectively.

2.1 The subfolder "single_cons_mat" contains 2630 pairs of ".mat" files. Each of the file is a three-dimensional digital matrix, which is the corresponding pixel values of the remote sensing image of one building.

2.2 The subfolder "single_cons_jpg" contains 2630 pairs of ".jpg" files, each of which is an image that is the visualization of the remote sensing image of one building and corresponds to each file in the folder "single_cons_mat".
